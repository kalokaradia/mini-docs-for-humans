# 🫁 How to Breathe Properly

> A simple guide for those who somehow forgot the `main()` function of being alive.

## 📖 Overview
Breathing is the core process that keeps your biological runtime from crashing.  
Most humans run it on autopilot, but occasionally the system lags — especially during stress, exams, or social interaction.

This doc explains how to optimize your breathing loop for performance and stability.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- A pair of working lungs (v1.0 or above)
- Access to oxygen (preferably clean)
- A moment of not pretending to be okay

## 🧩 Steps

### 1. Initialize the Process
Find a quiet spot, or at least one where you won’t be judged for existing.  
Sit upright; your spine is basically the Wi-Fi antenna for air.

### 2. Inhale
- Use your **nose** (it’s literally built for this).  
- Fill your lungs slowly for about **4 seconds**.  
- Don’t shrug your shoulders — your lungs are below them, not inside.

### 3. Hold
Pause for **2 seconds**.  
This gives your internal API time to process the new oxygen request.

### 4. Exhale
- Release through your **mouth** for **6 seconds**.  
- Pretend you’re sighing out all the cached stress and useless notifications.

### 5. Repeat
Loop the process at least **5 times** or until your brain stops buffering.

## 🧠 Tips
- Shallow breathing = bad performance. Think of it as low bandwidth for your bloodstream.  
- Overthinking your breathing defeats the purpose; trust the background thread.  
- If you sigh more than you breathe, try updating your life version.
