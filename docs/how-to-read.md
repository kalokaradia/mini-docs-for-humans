# 📘 How to Read Properly

> A step-by-step guide for humans who can recognize letters but not meaning.

---

## 📖 Overview
Reading is the ancient art of looking at squiggly symbols and pretending to understand them.  
Most people learn it at age 6, then promptly forget how to do it with focus.

This guide helps you recover that lost skill before your attention span expires.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- Two functioning eyes (or one determined one)  
- A brain with at least 2GB of free attention  
- Something worth reading (not your ex’s story)

## 🧩 Steps

### 1. Locate the Text
Open a book, article, or file that isn’t a meme.  
If it’s glowing and full of ads, you’re already in danger.

### 2. Focus Your Eyes
Direct your optical sensors toward the words.  
Avoid distractions like:
- Notifications  
- Existential dread  
- The urge to check if someone texted back  

### 3. Decode the Letters
Move your eyes **from left to right** (or right to left if you’re special).  
Let your brain convert the shapes into sounds and meaning.  
If your eyes move but your mind doesn’t—congrats, you’re scrolling.

### 4. Comprehend
Pause every few sentences and ask:  
> “Wait, do I actually get this?”  
If not, reread it instead of pretending.

### 5. Retain
Take notes, highlight, or mumble “interesting” while forgetting everything 5 minutes later.  
Optional upgrade: **teach someone else** — it’s the best way to prove you weren’t just staring at text.

## 🧠 Tips
- Don’t rush. You’re not defusing a bomb.  
- Avoid multitasking; reading while chatting is just high-level denial.  
- If you’re bored, it’s either the text’s fault or yours — debug accordingly.  
- Skimming is fine, but don’t call it “research.”

## 🪞 Troubleshooting
| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Rereading same line 5 times | Brain tabbed out | Close other mental tabs |
| Forgetting everything | Reading on autopilot | Summarize out loud |
| Falling asleep | Font sedative too strong | Sit up, breathe (see `how-to-breathe.md`) |
